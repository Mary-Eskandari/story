The night of the masquerade arrived, and Eliza donned a beautiful gown and a 
mask that concealed her identity. As she entered Everwood Manor, she was 
captivated by its grandeur. The ballroom was filled with masked guests, 
all dancing to the music of a magical orchestra. Eliza met a charming stranger, 
who seemed to share her adventurous spirit. They danced and talked, their masks 
concealing their true identities. The night was magical, but as the clock struck 
midnight, Eliza's mysterious companion disappeared, leaving behind only a single red rose.
