Once upon a time in a small, quiet village named Willowbrook, there lived a young 
woman named Eliza. She had always dreamt of adventure and excitement beyond the 
village's boundaries. One sunny morning, as she tended to her garden, a mysterious 
letter arrived. It was an invitation to a grand masquerade ball at the enchanting 
Everwood Manor deep within the nearby forest. Eliza couldn't resist the allure of 
the invitation and decided to attend, despite the rumors of the manor being haunted.
